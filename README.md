# musern

**musern** is a Python command-line utility designed to automatically rename music files based on their metadata. The goal of this project is to help users organize their music collections with consistent and meaningful file names.

## Current Status

Currently, **musern** can **read and display metadata** from music files but does not rename files or modify data.

## Features

### Current Features

- Extracts and displays metadata such as:
  - Title
  - Artist
  - Album
  - Track number
  - Genre
- Works with common audio file formats (e.g., MP3, FLAC).

### Planned Features

- Rename music files automatically based on customizable naming conventions.
- Batch processing for large libraries.
- Additional metadata editing and validation.
- Dry-run mode to preview changes.
